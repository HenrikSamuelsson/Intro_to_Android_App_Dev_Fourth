Android can be customized to individual needs since anyone can modify the code in the desired direction.

Android being open source and hence free of charge makes it possible to produce devices with competitive pricing.  

Open source software is much better at adhering to open standards than proprietary software is. This makes it easier to share documents and communicate with other users regardless of what device they use.
